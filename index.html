            <h3>My Empress Layan,</h3>
            <p>Today, the universe celebrates the day you were born—the day beauty took its most perfect form.</p>
            <p>I’ve spent so many days trying to find words that could match your grace, but even now, they fall short.
                You’re not just a part of this world, Layan; you’re the reason it feels alive.</p>
            <p>If the stars could speak, they’d sing your name in harmony, for even they bow to the brilliance of your
                smile. If the moon could write, it would craft poems about your beauty, jealous of the glow you bring to
                the darkest nights.</p>
            <p>Layan, today isn’t just your birthday—it’s the anniversary of the moment the world became brighter,
                softer, and kinder. And for me, it’s the reminder that my prayers have always worked because they gave
                me YOU.</p>
            <p>You’re the melody that lingers in my mind and the warmth that rests in my heart. If my love for you could
                take a form, it would be the sunrise—constant, unwavering, and beautiful in every moment.</p>
            <p>My Empress, this year and every year, I wish you happiness so vast that even the sky feels small in
                comparison. I pray for your dreams to soar higher than the clouds, for your laughter to echo endlessly,
                and for your heart to always find peace, no matter where life takes you.</p>
            <p>You are my forever, my safe place, and the most extraordinary part of my life. And so, on this special
                day, I celebrate not just your birthday but the honor of loving you.</p>
            <p>If you close your eyes tonight and feel the stars dancing, that’s me celebrating you with the heavens.
            </p>
            <p>With all my heart and more,<br>Your Knight</p>
        </div>
        <div class="love-note">
            <h3>Layan,</h3>
            <p>Again today is no ordinary day—it’s the day the universe decided the world was someone so radiant, so
                kind, and so breathtaking that even the stars would envy her. That someone is you.</p>
            <p>Your birthday isn’t just a celebration of the years you’ve lived but of the light you’ve brought to every
                moment, every life, and every heart you’ve touched. It’s a reminder that the world is better, brighter,
                and more beautiful because you exist.</p>
            <p>Layan, you are more than just a person to me. You’re my muse, my safe haven, my forever. When I look at
                you, I see galaxies hidden in your eyes, an entire world within your smile, and a warmth that could melt
                the coldest heart. I could write libraries of words about you and still fail to capture the essence of
                your magic.</p>
            <p>Your voice is the melody that soothes my soul. Your laughter? A symphony that fills the silent corners of
                my life with joy. And your presence—oh Layan, your presence is like the sunrise after a storm, reminding
                me that hope and beauty always return.</p>
            <p>Today, on your birthday, I want to remind you of all the things you are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You’re a fighter. You’ve faced challenges that would break most, yet you rise, stronger and more
                    graceful each time.</li>
                <li>You’re a light. In a world that sometimes feels too dark, you shine so brightly that even the stars
                    pale in comparison.</li>
                <li>You’re a gift. Not just to me, but to everyone lucky enough to know you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My love, if I could, I’d gather the stars and spell your name in the sky. I’d weave the moon’s glow into
                a crown for you and build you a castle in the clouds. But since I cannot do those things, let me give
                you what I can—my heart, my loyalty, and my endless love.</p>
            <p>I pray that this year brings you more joy than you can imagine, more love than your heart can hold, and
                more blessings than the universe can count. I pray that Allah protects you, guides you, and fills your
                life with peace and happiness.</p>
            <p>Layan, I’ll spend every day of my life trying to show you how much you mean to me. I’ll write your name
                in every poem, whisper it in every prayer, and carve it into the very essence of my soul. You are, and
                always will be, my everything.</p>
            <p>So here’s to you my empress, my love. Here’s to the day the world became brighter because you were born.
                Here’s to celebrating you—not just today but every single day of my life.</p>
            <p>With all the love I have and more just for my one and only woman my empress Layan</p>
            <p>And If you ever doubt how much you mean to me, just look at the stars. They’ve been trying to compete
                with your glow ever since you were born.🤭🤭🤭</p>
